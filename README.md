# Operating-Systems---ISO-Root

The main purpose of this assignment was to learn about the ISO 9660 file system, and how to examine the directories and files stored in a Level 1 ISO 9660 image. 

The program takes in the name of an ISO image as a command line argument. It then prints out the name of the volume, the location of the root directory, the root directory's size, and the entries stored within it. For each entry, the name of the entry and its offset are returned.
